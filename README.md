# FizzBuzz-Classic

Write a program that, given a number n from STDIN, prints out all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) to STDOUT, each on their own line. But there's a catch:

- For numbers divisible by 3, instead of n, print Fizz

- For numbers divisible by 5, instead of n, print Buzz

- For numbers divisible by 3 and 5, just print FizzBuzz

For example, given the input 1, your program should output:

> 1

Another example, given the input 15, your program should output:

> 1

> 2

> Fizz

> 4

> Buzz

> Fizz

> 7

> 8

> Fizz

> Buzz

> 11

> Fizz

> 13

> 14

> FizzBuzz
